map <pair<int, int>, int> mp;
pair <int, int> temp = {3, 5};
value = 2332;
mp[temp] = value;


(3, 5) -> 2332



pair <int, int> p;
vector <int> v(2);
v[0] -> p.first;


two kinds of maps
map<pair<int, int>, int> mp;
map<vector<int>, int>> mp2;

first kind of pairs of triples -> b1 != c1 (others are same)
go through the array, looking at each triple
look at the second and third element of the current triple
put it in a map
